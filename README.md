# Rankify
The idea behind Rankify is to ensure that customer reviews are genuine, utilizing unique QR codes and Blockchain. The concept aims to verify the use of a product or service without requiring users to register an account or provide personal information. This project primarily focuses on restaurant reviews, envisioning collaboration between a company (similar to Tripadvisor) and restaurants to provide visitors with unique QR codes after their visit.
